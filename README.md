# Movie-Ratings

## Problem Statement

You have been approached as an analytics consultant by a movie reviews website. They are writing up an article analysing movie ratings by critics and audience as well as movie budgets for the years 2007-2011.

This is the first time they are doing this analysis and they donâ€™t know exactly what they need. They have asked you to look into the data and provide them with 5 graphs that tell a story about the data.

However, there is one chart the CEO specifically requested - a diagram showing how the correlation between audience and critic ratings has evolved throughout the years by genre. This is in addition to the other 5.
