# Movie-Ratings

## Problem Statement

You have been approached as an analytics consultant by a movie review website to assist with an article analyzing movie ratings from critics and audiences, as well as movie budgets, for the years 2007-2011. Since this is their first time conducting such an analysis, they are unsure of their exact needs and have asked you to explore the data and create 5 graphs that tell a compelling story. Additionally, the CEO has specifically requested a chart that illustrates how the correlation between audience and critic ratings has changed over the years by genre, in addition to the other 5 graphs.
